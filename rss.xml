            <description><![CDATA[<p>I make games, iOS games. I do that because I like to create things, after all creating is rooted deep in the human race. I always liked computer science, because it enables you to materialise your dreams. You're the source of the idea, you're the designer, you're the one doing the dirty work, and sometimes you get the chance to work in a team, that thinks the same way. Making computer games is perhaps the most rewarding thing in computer science. Games often have interesting logic, and they also have a human interface, thus they have it all. You need to figure out how to achieve your goals in the computer world, but also to amuse the humans. If there's such thing as a full-stack developer, then an independent one-man show game developer is a little bit more that that. </p>]]></description>
