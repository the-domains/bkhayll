# Purple Road

My new game will be called Purple Road. That's the plan anyway. Okay, this time I'm going to make the controls as intuitive and easy as I can. That wasn't the case with my games so far, and I do think this is one of the reasons people don't understand them. It's hard to tell the story in your head in the form of a game, when most people are expecting something instantly loveable. I guess I'm on the right track, people don't ask me, "What should I do?" when I show them the latest version. With simplicity however comes the challenge. How do you make something, that does not get boring after 10 minutes? Now I haven't figured out that yet... I'll be trying though.

I recently got the advice to offer rewards to the players after finishing a "level". The idea is elaborated in this video: [HOOKED: HOW TO BUILD HABIT-FORMING PRODUCTS BY NIR EYAL ANIMATED][0] worth watching. Yeah, so I'll do that. I have some ideas, but I need to implement them to see if they works. In my first game (with the terrible name of) [Four: The Space Fight][1] I did have some form of interlude between two levels, but the purpose was't to reward players, at least not intentionally.

Then there's another thing, you need to introduce complexity gradually. Easy-peasy, right? Actually I find this really hard, because for this to really work you'll need an idea, that "scales". Now you can't really scale [Flappy Bird][2], can you? One of the best examples from contemporary games is [Two Dots][3]. I wonder how long they can find out new mechanisms without the game getting boring. Oh, and I really like their business model. It's one of the best I've seen so far. I'll take some inspiration from them. I always hated the Ad supported model, but I have to realise, that people like "free" things. Two Dots mastered the way to ask for money at the right time, when the players are the most frustrated with not being able to finish that damn level :)
